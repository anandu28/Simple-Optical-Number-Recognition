# Simple Optical Number Recognition
Uses a simple neural network provided by pybrain to recognize numbers from image inputs. The training data used is from MNIST and should be places in a folder called 'data'. The network is trained in iterations of 3 epochs, with each iteration getting a new subset of training data. The network is tested after each training iteration. The iteration of training and testing continue until the target accuracy of 75% is reached. Reaching this accuracy usually takes around 20 iterations. After a sufficient accuracy is reached, the testing set will be iterated over with each image being displayed using motplotlib and a number being estimated with the final neural network.
